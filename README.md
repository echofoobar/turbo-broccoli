# Quantitative analysis

We used CT-scan images from TCIA Archive.

## Preprocessing

- First 32bit .tiff images were converted to 1bit .tiff images as for our research we are interested only in binary type of matrices. Conversion happened with command `magick mogrify -format tif -depth 1 *.tif`
in the correct folder.  
- Next we generated matricies from these tiff images with python. In these matricies zero represents black pixel and one white pixel.

## Independet and dependent variables

- With python we also generated preliminary matrix conversion to Block Storage Format
- In our research our independent variables are the matricies generated from CT-scan images and dependent variables are the sizes of the matricies in the Block Storage Row format.
- - As the CT-scan images have same amount of pixels 512x512, only property here are the black and white pixels.
- - For the matrix storage format we are interested in the pixels that are important to store and therefore interesting properties for dependent variable are the space and time the storage format requires.
